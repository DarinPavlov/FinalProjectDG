                        director Frederik Schmidt-Degener in cooperation
                        with the Rijksgebouwendienst (Government Buildings

                        of the building in 1924. After the death of Pierre
                        Cuypers, a start is made on removing and covering
                        up some of the decorations in consultation with
                        Joseph Cuypers, who succeeds his father as official
